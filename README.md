##  Introduction

This project investigates Spotifyâ€™s audio feature dataset through data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. The main goals include:
- Understanding if a hit song boosts popularity for other album tracks.
- Predicting artist collaborations using classification models.
- Building a song recommender based on audio similarity.

The case study demonstrates practical use of regression, classification, and unsupervised learning in music intelligence.

##  Models

| Model               | Purpose                       | AUC Score | Notes                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Linear Regression   | Impact of hit songs on albums | \~0.01 RÂ² | Weak relationship found |
| Logistic Regression | Predict collaborations        | \~0.63    | Regularized, polynomial |
| Random Forest       | Predict collaborations        | \~0.90    | Best performer          |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Recommend similar tracks      | N/A       | Exploratory recommender |

##  Results

* **Random Forest** outperformed all classifiers with an AUC \~0.90.
* **Logistic Regression** had moderate success with \~0.63 AUC.
* **Linear Regression** did not support the hypothesis that hits improve sibling track popularity.
* KNN model demonstrated practical usage of unsupervised learning.

---

##  Dependencies

Key libraries used:

* `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`
* `jupyterlab` or `notebook` for interactive analysis

For full list, see [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) or [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

---

## Configuration

* All data preprocessing scripts and feature transformation logic are centralized in `src/data_prep.py`.
* Modeling parameters are defined inside each model script.
* Class balancing and scaling handled within modeling pipelines.

---

##  Dataset

* Spotify Tracks Dataset
* \~114,000 tracks with features like:

  * `danceability`, `energy`, `liveness`, `valence`, etc.
* [Reference and schema notes here](references/dataset.md)

**Note**: Raw dataset is excluded from the repo due to size constraints.

---

##  Examples

* ROC curve comparison between Logistic Regression and Random Forest
* Feature importance from Random Forest
* Distribution plots for popularity, tempo, and more
* Residual plots for linear and weighted regression

---

##  Limitations & Future Work

* **Limitations**:

  * Class imbalance required resampling
  * Model assumptions not always satisfied
  * Dataset excluded listener behavior and release timing

* **Future Directions**:

  * Include sentiment or lyric embeddings
  * Explore deep learning and sequential models
  * Use listener play counts or temporal trends
